1. What happens if you remove the go-command from the Seek call in the main function?
- every call to Seek will wait until the previous call is finished, and the result will be that
  the names are in the same order on every run

2. What happens if you switch the declaration wg := new(sync.WaitGroup) to var wg sync.WaitGroup and the parameter wg *sync.WaitGroup to wg sync.WaitGroup?
- instead of passing the waitgroup by reference, we are now passing it by value which means that
  our calls to wg.Done in seek isn't called on the original waitgroup, but on waitgroup that is 
  local to the Seek function
